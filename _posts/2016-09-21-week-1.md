#Week 1 - Project Proposal
Just posting some images of the work I did for week 1 in proposing a final project. This is a smart trail light. It functions as part of a set of trail lights to allow users (running or walking) to log their progress. I'll post more information about what I have in mind and why this is neat when I have more time...class starts in 30min.
